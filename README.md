# Coronavirus2019_Analysis
The 2019-nCoV is a contagious coronavirus that hailed from Wuhan, China. This new strain of virus has striked fear in many 
countries as cities are quarantined and hospitals are overcrowded. I make some data analysis to help us understand how 
2019-nCoV is spread aroud the world.
I would like to acknowledge Johns Hopkins University for open-sourcing their dataset. Their dataset is transformed into a 
format that is easier for kaggle to handle.
